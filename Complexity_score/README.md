# Details of Complexity Score

Below figure shows the trend of complexity score for A2.   
Details are in Evaluation section; Trend of Complexity Score.   
Fixed point is observed as explained with the A1 case.

There are differences between missions, but they all converge around 6 hours.

For A4, converged point is earlier than the other algoritms, bug general trend is similar.   
Also, how fast or slow it can converge depends on the parameter of mutation strageties and whether there is enough space for additional mutated obstacle or not.   
Details are in Trend of Complexity Score sub-section in Evaluation section.
