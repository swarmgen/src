# Adaptive Swarm

This is for the new swarm project.
**replay**

## Quick start

```bash
$ python2 src/planner.py adswarm -k vanilla -rs <seed rand num start> -re <seed rand num end>
$ python3 src/planner.py tgswarm -k vanilla -rs 1 -re 2
```

Using python3 would be good for your mental health.

## Result

All files in `output` folder and `seedpool` folder are very important.
Please pack and send me. :)

## When the experiment is stopped unexpectively,

Just start again.
It will continue from the latest point.
